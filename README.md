Project Description:

I studied the "Netflix Movies" and TV Shows dataset. I extract insight from the dataset and visualized them using matplotlib and seaborn. 
I created a Movie and TV Show recommandation system using Cosine Similarity feature in sklearn. The recommandation system takes one movie or TV Show the user watched and recommands 10 other contents based on it.
